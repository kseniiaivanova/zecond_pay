# Eventura – RedwoodJS + Zaver Integration

**Eventura** is a demo web app simulating an event booking and ticketing flow with online payment support. It integrates [Zaver](https://zaver.com) into a [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com) project, demonstrating how companies can accept payments.

This project runs in a test environment - no real payments are processed. After completing a booking, the app sends a simulated ticket via email using [Make](https://www.make.com/en) automation.

> **Target audience**: Developers and startups using RedwoodJS who want to explore payment integration in projects involving product or service sales.

- Guiding users step-by-step through the booking and payment process
- Providing clear status feedback and confirmation
- Ensuring visual clarity and accessibility on desktop and mobile
