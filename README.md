# README

Welcome to Eventura! This is an example of a RedwoodJS-Zaver integration made as an event booking simulation. Integration allows companies using [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com) accept online payments. No real payments are made with this app so you can test the payment flow. The tickets are sent to user's mail via [Make](https://www.make.com/en) automation.

The target audience of the application can be defined as startups using RedwoodJS in development and
selling so-called durable goods and services.

> **Prerequisites**

> - Redwood requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (=18.x) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (>=1.15)
> - Are you on Windows? For best results, follow our [Windows development setup](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/how-to/windows-development-setup) guide
